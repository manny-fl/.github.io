Original Template - https://uicookies.com/downloads/trainer-free-html5-template-using-bootstrap-fitness-websites/

1. Modified Template to be a one page website containing only what I consider neccessary as a Personal Trainer.

2. Why I created this site? 

ANSWER - I am a personal trainer and creating a website is something useful for potential clients.  However, My clients prior to learning web design
came from word of mouth.
